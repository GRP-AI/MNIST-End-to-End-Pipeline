MNIST Digit Classification — Classical ML vs Deep Learning: 

A complete, end‑to‑end benchmark comparing five different models on the MNIST handwritten digit dataset. This project evaluates classical machine learning algorithms alongside deep learning architectures to understand performance differences, training behavior, and generalization.

What This Notebook Includes: 

Data loading & preprocessing

Normalization for ML & DL pipelines

Flattening for classical ML

Channel expansion for CNN

Training loops for all models

Confusion matrices

Learning curves

Accuracy comparison bar chart

Final summary & insights

Results Summary: 

CNN performs best due to spatial feature extraction  

Classical ML models still provide strong baselines  

MLP bridges the gap but lacks spatial awareness

Tech Stack: 

Python

NumPy, Pandas

Scikit‑Learn

TensorFlow / Keras

Matplotlib, Seaborn
